# Example App

A Flutter application to reference my code.
The idea was an app to organize events and share the calendar and images/news/etc..
It was a project to learn more about Flutter and experiment with some things.

## Getting Started

You'll find my code in the "lib" directory.
To see the result open MYFAM_MAIN_GUI.png.
